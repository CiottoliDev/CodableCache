# CodableCache
What is Codable Cache? It's a framework that allows for seamless memory caching and disk persistence of your plain old Swift structs. Simply define a model and conform to `Encodable` â€“ you're ready to use Codable Cache.

##ðŸŽ“ Some History

Codable Cache is a drop in replacement for my [LeanCache](https://github.com/asowers1/LeanCache) framework, which was backed by specifying generic types conforming to `NSCoding`. It afforded workflows like `let x: NSNumber? = Cache<NSNumber>("some interesting key")` and that's still great, but writing serializers for `NSCoding` is a pain. Hence, `CodableCache` was born.



The memory cache of `Codable Cache` is backed up by
